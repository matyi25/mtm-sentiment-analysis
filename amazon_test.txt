[...] down the drain because of a weak snap!$50 Down the drain.1. long lasting battery (you don't have to recharge it as frequentyly as some of the flip phones)2.A Disappointment."A must study for anyone interested in the ""worst sins"" of industrial design."A PIECE OF JUNK THAT BROKE AFTER BEING ON MY PHONE FOR 2 DAYS!!!A usable keyboard actually turns a PDA into a real-world useful machine instead of just a neat gadget.Absolutel junk.Adapter does not provide enough charging current.After 3 months, screen just went black all of a sudden.After a year the battery went completely dead on my headset.After my phone got to be about a year old, it's been slowly breaking despite much care on my part.After receiving and using the product for just 2 days it broke.AFter the first charge kept going dead after 12 minutes.All I can do is whine on the Internet, so here it goes.The more I use the thing the less I like it.All in all, I'd expected a better consumer experience from Motorola.All it took was one drop from about 6 inches above the kitchen counter and it was cracked.I am not impressed and I am not laughing.All three broke within two months of use.Also difficult to put on.I'd recommend avoiding this product.Also the area where my unit broke).- I'm not too fond of the magnetic strap.Also, if your phone is dropped, this case is not going to save it, specially when dropped face down.Also, the phone doesn't seem to accept anything except CBR mp3s, preferably ripped by Windows Media Player.AMAZON SUCKS.And none of the tones is acceptable.And the sound quality is great.Another note about this phone's appearance is that it really looks rather bland, especially in the all black model.As an earlier review noted, plug in this charger and nothing happens.As I said above....PRETTY USELESS!As many people complained, I found this headset's microphone was very weak.At first I thought I was grtting a good deal at $7.44, until I plugged it into my phone (V3c Razr).Att is not clear, sound is very distorted and you have to yell when you talk.Audio Quality is poor, very poor.Avoid this one if you can.Awkward to use and unreliable.Bad Choice.bad fit, way too big.Bad Purchase.Bad Quality.Bad Reception.Basically the service was very bad.Battery has no life.Battery is terrible.Battery lasts only a few hours.Battery life still not long enough in Motorola Razor V3i.Big Disappointment with calendar sync.Bluetooth does not work, phone locks up, screens just flash up and now it just makes calls randomly while in my pocket locked.Bought mainly for the charger, which broke soon after purchasing.BT50 battery junk!."But now that it is ""out of warranty"" the same problems reoccure.Bottom line... put your money somewhere else... Cingular will not support it."But when I check voice mail at night, the keypad backlight turns off a few seconds into the first message, and then I'm lost.Buttons are too small.Buyer--Be Very Careful!!!!!.camera color balance is AWFUL.Can't store anything but phone numbers to SIM.Can't upload ringtones from a third party.Cant get the software to work with my computer.Car charger as well as AC charger are included to make sure you never run out of juice.Highy recommendedCase was more or less an extra that I originally put on but later discarded because it scratched my ear.Chinese Forgeries Abound!.Could not get strong enough signal.Couldn't figure it outCouldn't use the unit with sunglasses, not good in Texas!Cumbersome design.Customer service was terrible.Defective crap.Design Flaw?.Disapointing Results.Disappointed!.disappointed.Disappointing accessory from a good manufacturer.disappointing.Disappointment.. I hate anything that goes in my ear.DO NOT BUY DO NOT BUYIT SUCKSDo NOT buy if you want to use the holster.Do not make the same mistake as me.DO NOT PURCHASE THIS PHONE.Does not charge the Cingular (ATT) 8525 phone.Does not fit.Does not fit.Does not work for listening to music with the cingular 8125.Does Not Work.Doesn't do the job.doesn't last long.Doesn't work at all.. I bougth it for my L7c and its not working.Doesn't Work.Don't bother - go to the store.Don't buy it.Don't buy this product - It fails!.Don't buy this product.Don't buy this product.Don't make the same mistake I did.Don't make the same mistake that I did and please don't buy this phone.Don't trust their website and don't expect any helpful support.Don't waste your $$$ on this one.don't waste your money and time.Don't waste your money!.don't waste your money.dont buy it.Due to this happening on every call I was forced to stop using this headset.During several different 2 minute calls, I experienced 5 drops and it was in an area that had 5 bars.Earbud piece breaks easily.Echo Problem....Very unsatisfactoryEverything about it is fine and reasonable for the price i.e.Everything about this product is wrong.FirstExcellent bluetooth headset.Excellent starter wireless headset.Finally, after three or four times the spring of the latch broke and I could not use it any longer on the visor.First of all, it doesn't wear well.First off the reception sucks, I have never had more than 2 bars, ever.Freezes frequently4.Good case, Excellent value.good protection and does not make phone too bulky.Great choice!Great for iPODs too.Great for the jawbone.Great Pocket PC / phone combination.Having trouble with volume.He was very impressed when going from the original battery to the extended battery.Highly recommend for any one who has a blue tooth phone.Horrible phone.horrible, had to switch 3 times.Horrible, horrible protector.How can that be?The audio quality is poor.How stupid is that?However I needed some better instructions.However-the riingtones are not the best, and neither are the games.However, after about a year, the fliptop started to get loose and wobbly and eventually my screen went black and I couldn't receive and place calls.However, BT headsets are currently not good for real time games like first-person shooters since the audio delay messes me up.however, my girl was complain that some time the phone doesn't wake up like normal phone does.However, the ear pads come off easily and after only one week I lost one.However, the keypads are so tinny that I sometimes reach the wrong buttons."I also didn't like the ""on"" button, it felt like it would crack with use."I am going to have to be the first to negatively review this product.I am not impressed with this and i would not recommend this item to anyone.I am sorry I made this purchase.I bought these hoping I could make my Bluetooth headset fit better but these things made it impossible to wear.I bought this phone as a replacement for my StarTac and have regretted it since.I bought this to use with my Kindle Fire and absolutely loved it!I bought two of them and neither will charge.I came over from Verizon because cingulair has nicer cell phones.... the first thing I noticed was the really bad service."I can barely ever hear on it and am constantly saying ""what?"""I can't use this case because the smell is disgusting.I cannot make calls at certain places.I checked everywhere and there is no feature for it which is really disappointing.I contacted the company and they told me that, although the unit was still under warranty, if I couldn't produce my receipt I was out of luck.I could not recommend these more.I did not bother contacting the company for few dollar product but I learned the lesson that I should not have bought this form online anyway.I didn't want the clip going over the top of my ear, causing discomfort.I does not maintain a connection with the computer while it is on my lap.I don't like this Nokia either.I don't think it would hold it too securly on your belt.I even dropped this phone into a stream and it was submerged for 15 seconds and it still works great!I even fully charged it before I went to bed and turned off blue tooth and wi-fi and noticed that it only had 20 % left in the morning.I find this inexcusable and so will probably be returning this phone and perhaps changing carriers.I get absolutely horrible reception in my apartment, where with other phones I have not had this problem."I give Wirefly 1 star.I will contact Cingular/AT&T; and inform them of this practice."I got the car charger and not even after a week the charger was broken...I went to plug it in and it started smoking.i got this phone around the end of may and i'm completely unhappy with it.I had to purchase a different case.I have 2-3 bars on my cell phone when I am home, but you cant not hear anything.I have been very happy with the 510 and have had NO complaints from any one regarding my sound quality on their end.I have bought this Nokia cell phone a few weeks ago and it was a nightmare.I have had problems wit hit dropping signal and more.I have had this phone for over a year now, and I will tell you, its not that great.I have this phone and it is a thorn in my side, I really abhor it.I have yet to run this new battery below two bars and that's three days without charging.I kept catching the cable on the seat and I had to pull the phone out to turn it on an off.I love this phone , It is very handy and has a lot of features .I love this thing!I might have gotten a defect, but I would not risk buying it again because of the built quality alone.I only used it two days, and it wasn't always easy to hear with.I ordered this for sony Ericsson W810i but I think it only worked once (thats when I first used it).I ordered this product first and was unhappy with it immediately.I plugged it in only to find out not a darn thing worked.I purcashed this for the car charger and it does not work.I put the latest OS on it (v1.15g), and it now likes to slow to a crawl and lock up every once in a while.I really recommend this faceplates since it looks very nice, elegant and cool.I really wanted the Plantronics 510 to be the right one, but it has too many issues for me.The goodI received my supposedly new motorola 375 and apparently there was not a match between the phone and the charger.I recently had problems where I could not stay connected for more than 10 minutes before being disconnected.I still maintain that monkeys shouldn't make headphones, we just obviously don't share enough DNA to copy the design over to humans.I tried talking real loud but shouting on the telephone gets old and I was still told it wasn't great.I used to talk on it for 1 - 1 1/2 hours and the battery would be literally drained and dying.I want my money back.I Was Hoping for More.I was not happy with this item.I was sitting in my vehicle, with the cradle on my belt, and the headset lost signal.I wasted my little money with this earpiece.I wear it everyday and it holds up very well.I wish I could return the unit and get back my money.i would advise to not purchase this item it never worked very well.I would have given no star if I was able.I would not recommend this item to anyone.I wouldn't recommend buying this product.I'd like to return it.I'll be drivng along, and my headset starts ringing for no reason.I'll be looking for a new earpiece.I'm a bit disappointed.I'm really disappointed all I have now is a charger that doesn't work.I'm returning them.I'm trying to return it for a refund.I've also had problems with the phone reading the memory card in which I always turn it on and then off again.I've bought $5 wired headphones that sound better than these.I've had this bluetoooth headset for some time now and still not comfortable with the way it fits on the ear.I've missed numerous calls because of this reason.I've owned this phone for 7 months now and can say that it's the best mobile phone I've had.If I take a picture, the battery drops a bar, and starts beeping, letting me know its dieing.If there is a wind, it is completely useless.If you are looking for a good quality Motorola Headset keep looking, this isn't it.If you are Razr owner...you must have this!If you don't find it, too bad, as again the unit comes with one earpad only.I would not recommend this to anyone.If you hate earbugs, avoid this phone by all means.If you like a loud buzzing to override all your conversations, then this phone is for you!If you like a loud buzzing to override all your conversations, then this phone is for you!if you simply want a small flip phone -- look elsewhere as the extra bells & whistles are mediocre.Improper description.... I had to return it."in addition it feels &amp; looks as if the phone is all lightweight cheap plastic."In my house I was getting dropped coverage upstairs and no coverage in my basement.Internet is excrutiatingly slow.It also had a new problem.It always cuts out and makes a beep beep beep sound then says signal failed.It defeats the purpose of a bluetooth headset.it did not work in my cell phone plug i am very up set with the charger!.It didn't charge for me.It didn't work, people can not hear me when I talk.It dit not work most of the time with my Nokia 5320.It doesn't make you look cool.It doesn't work in Europe or Asia.It feels more comfortable than most headsets because I wear glasses and that gets in the way sometimes.It feels poorly constructed, the menus are difficult to navigate, and the buttons are so recessed that it is difficult to push them."It felt too light and ""tinny.""."It has a great camera thats 2MP, and the pics are nice and clear with great picture quality.It has all the features I wantIt has kept up very well.It is cheap, and it feel and look just as cheap.It is practically useless and did not add any kind of boost to my reception after I bought it.It lasts less than 3o minutes, if I actually try to use the phone.My wife has the same phone with the same problem.It looses connection to the phone even when it is within a couple feet between the two.It makes very strange ticking noises before it ends the call.It only recognizes the Phone as its storage device.It was a waste of my money.It was an inexpensive piece, but I would still have expected better quality.It was horrible!.It would take too long to describe how bad my customer service experience has been with Amazon.It's A PIECE OF CRAP!It's AGGRAVATING!It's kind of embarrassing to use because of how it looks and mostly it's embarrassing how child-like the company is.It's not what it says it is.It's so stupid to have to keep buying new chargers, car chargers, cradles, headphones and car kits every time a new phone comes out.It's uncomfortable and the sound quality is quite poor compared with the phone (Razr) or with my previous wired headset (that plugged into an LG).Item Does Not Match Picture.Items stated as included from the description ARE NOT INCLUDED.its extremely slow and takes forever to do anything with it.Its not user friendly.Its reception is very very poor.Just does not work.Kind of flops around.Last time buying from you.Lasted one day and then blew up.Linksys should have some way to exchange a bad phone for a refurb unit or something!Looks good in the picture, but this case was a huge disappointment!!Lousy product.Love this product.Low Quality.Made very sturdy.Makes it easier to keep up with my bluetooth when I'm not wearing it.Muddy, low quality sound, and the casing around the wire's insert was poorly super glued and slid off.My 5-year old Nokia 2160 from Tracfone holds the charge a lot better than this.My experience was terrible..... This was my fourth bluetooth headset, and while it was much more comfortable than my last Jabra (which I HATED!!!My father has the V265, and the battery is dying.My only complaint is the standard sound volume is a little low even when turned up to 5(of 5)My phone sounded OK ( not great - OK), but my wife's phone was almost totally unintelligible, she couldn't understand a word being said on it.Never got it!!!!!Nice docking station for home or work.Nice headset priced right.No additional ear gels provided, and no instructions whatsoever.No buyers remorse on this one!.No real improvement.None of it works, just don't buy it.none of the new ones have ever quite worked properly.None of the three sizes they sent with the headset would stay in my ears.Not a good item.. It worked for a while then started having problems in my auto reverse tape player.Not as good as I had hoped.Not enough volume.Not good enough for the price.Not good when wearing a hat or sunglasses.Not impressed.Not nearly as good looking as the AMAZON picture makes it look.Not only will it drain your player, but may also potentially fry it.NOT WHAT I WANTED.Not worth it.Obviously there is a problem with the adhesive.Obviously they have a terrible customer service, so you get what you pay for.Oh and I forgot to also mention the weird color effect it has on your phone.One thing I hate is the mode set button at the side.Painful on the ear.Performed awful -- muffled, tinny incoming sound and severe echo for those on the other end of the call.Perhaps my phone is defective, but people cannot hear me when I use this.Phone falls out easily.Piece of Junk.Piece of trash.Please dont waste your money.Plug was the wrong size.Plus, I seriously do not believe it is worth its steep price point.Poor Construction.Poor product.poor quality and service.Poor quality.Poor Reliability.Poor sound quality.poor voice clarity.Poorly contstruct hinge.Pretty piece of junk.Problem is that the ear loops are made of weak material and break easily.Product is useless, since it does not have enough charging current to charge the 2 cellphones I was planning to use it with.Product was excellent and works better than the verizon one and Boy was it cheaper!Reaching for the bottom row is uncomfortable, and the send and end keys are not where I expect them to be.3.REALLY UGLY.Reception is terrible and full of static.Returned 8 hours later.Rip off---- Over charge shipping.Saggy, floppy piece of junk.Same problem as others have mentioned.Save your money.... I've had this item for 11 months now.Sending it back.So anyone near you will hear part of your conversation.So Far So Good!.So I basically threw my money out the window for nothing.So I had to take the battery out of the phone put it all back together and then restart it.So just beware.Soyo technology sucks.Sprint - terrible customer service.Sprint charges for this service.Stay Away From the Q!.stay away from this store, be careful.Steer clear of this product and go with the genuine Palm replacementr pens, which come in a three-pack.Still Waiting...... I'm sure this item would work well.. if I ever recieve it!sucked, most of the stuff does not work with my phone.Talk about USELESS customer service.Terrible phone holder.Terrible product, and waste of money!Terrible.. My car will not accept this cassette.Thank you for wasting my money.That company is a joke.THAT one didn't work either.That's a huge design flaw (unless I'm not using it correctly, which I don't think is the case).The battery is completely useless to me.The battery is unreliable as well as the service use antena.The battery life is highly unacceptable.The biggest complaint I have is, the battery drains superfast.The bottowm line...another worthless, cheap gimmick from Sprint.The BT headset was such a disapoinment.The cable looks so thin and flimsy, it is scary.The calls drop, the phone comes on and off at will, the screen goes black and the worst of all it stops ringing intermittently.The camera on the phone may be used as a dustpan when indoors... I'd rather be using a disposable then this.The camera, although rated at an impressive 1.3 megapixels, renders images that fall well below expectations of such a relatively high resolution.The case is a flimsy piece of plastic and has no front or side protection whatsoever.The case is great and works fine with the 680.The charger arrived within the promised timeframe, but it did not work.the charger worked for about a week and then completely stopped charging my phone.The design might be ergonomic in theory but I could not stand having these in my ear.The earpiece on this is too large or too heavy...it keeps falling out of my ear.The first thing that happened was that the tracking was off.The headsets are easy to use and everyone loves them.The holster that arrived did not match the photo in the ad.The instruction manual is lacking.The instructions didn't explain that a microphone jack could be used.The internet access was fine, it the rare instance that it worked.The item received was Counterfeit.The loudspeaker option is great, the bumpers with the lights is very ... appealing.The majority of the Logitech earbud headsets failed.The mic is great.The mic there is a joke, and the volume is quite low.The nano stated it.My son was dissapointed.The Ngage is still lacking in earbuds.The nokia CA-42 USB cable did not work with my phone.The only thing that disappoint me is the infra red port (irda).The only thing that I think could improve is the sound leaks out from the headset.the only VERY DISAPPOINTING thing was there was NO SPEAKERPHONE!!!!The phone crashed completely and now I have to get it replaced.The phone gets EXTREMELY HOT!The phone loads super!The phone takes FOREVER to charge like 2 to 5 hours literally.the phone was unusable and was not new.The picture resolution is far below what other comparably-priced phones are offering today.The plastic breaks really easy on this clip.The pleather case doesn't fit.The plug did not work very well.The real killer is the volume, and of course it breaking.The replacement died in a few weeks.The screen does get smudged easily because it touches your ear and face.The sound quality for the device is unacceptable.Unless you are in a really quiet area, you almost hear nothing.The speaker is of low quality so as making the ring tones sound very cheap.The text messaging feature is really tricky to use.The update procedure is difficult and cumbersome.The volume switch rocketed out of the unit to a destination unknown.the worst phone from samsung...crap..... this crappy Samsung E715.. is the worst i have ever seeen.The worst phone I've ever had.... Only had it for a few months.The worst piece of crap ever along with the Verizon customer service.Their network coverage in Los Angeles is horrible.Then a few days later the a puff of smoke came out of the phone while in use.Then I exchanged for the same phone, even that had the same problem.Then I had to continue pairing it periodically since it somehow kept dropping.There was so much hype over this phone that I assumed it was the best, my mistake.There's a horrible tick sound in the background on all my calls that I have never experienced before.There's really nothing bad I can say about this headset.These headphones were a great find - and I think they are perhaps the best purchase I've made in the last several years - seriously.These products cover up the important light sensor above the ear outlet.They do not care about the consumer one bit.They made this case too small and is very difficult to install.They refuse to refund or replace.They work about 2 weeks then break.Think it over when you plan to own this one!This sure is the last MOTO phone for me!This allows the possibility of double booking for the same date and time after the first.This case seems well made.This company charge me a restocking fee and still not given me my refund back.This device is great in several situations:1.)This does not fit the Palm Tungsten E2 and it broke the first time I tried to plug it in.This is a beautiful phone.This is a great little item.This is a VERY average phone with bad battery life that operates on a weak network.This is by far the worst purchase I've made on Amazon.This is essentially a communications tool that does not communicate.This is infuriating.This is so embarassing and also my ears hurt if I try to push the ear plug into my ear.This is the first phone I've had that has been so cheaply made.This pair of headphones is the worst that I have ever had sound-wise.This particular model would not work with my Motorola Q smartphone.This phone is pretty sturdy and I've never had any large problems with it.This phone might well be the worst I've ever had in any brand.This phone tries very hard to do everything but fails at it's very ability to be a phone.This phone works great.This product had a strong rubber/petroleum smell that was unbearable after a while and caused me to return itThis product is clearly not ready for prime time, I don't care how cool it looks, if you can't tell a call is coming in it's worthless.This product is ideal for people like me whose ears are very sensitive.This product is very High quality Chinese CRAP!!!!!!This results in the phone being either stuck at max volume or mute.This was utterly confusing at first, which caused me to lose a couple of very, very important contacts.Too bad you have to pay up to $$$ a month for the service!Treo and T-Mobile refused to replace it again and forced me to buy another phone without any kind of upgrade discount.Truly awful.Trying to make a call on these is an exercise in frustration.Uncomfortable In the Ear, Don't use with LG VX9900 (EnV).Unfortunately it did not work.Unfortunately it will not recharge my iPhone 4s, despite connecting it from multiple power sources (iMac, external battery, wall outlet, etc).Unfortunately it's easy to accidentally activate them with the gentle-touch buttons if you accidentally touch the phone to your face while listening.Unfortunately the ability to actually know you are receiving a call is a rather important feature and this phone is pitiful in that respect.Unreliable - I'm giving up.Used and dirty.useless phone, simply deaf.Using all earpieces, left or right, this thing will not stay on my ear.Utter crap.. Sound quality is TERRIBLE.Verizon tech support walked my through a few procedures, none of which worked and I ended up having to do a hard re-set, wiping out all my data.Verizon's bills, however, are difficult to understand even though their pricing plans are simple.VERY cheap plastic, creaks like an old wooden floor.Very disappointed in AccessoryOne.very disappointed.Very disappointing.Very Displeased.Very Dissapointing Performance.Very good quality thoughVery much disappointed with this company.Very unreliable service from T-mobile !Voice Quality, Signal Strength, Dropped Calls.WARNING - DO NOT BUY!!.Warning - Stay away.Was not happy.Waste of 13 bucks.Waste of money.We are sending it back.We have tried 2 units and they both failed within 2 months.. ProsWe received a WHITE colored battery that goes DEAD after a couple hoursTHe original used to last a week - but still lasts longer than thereplacementWell packaged, arrived on time, and works as intended.Were JERKS on the phone.What a big waste of time.what a disappointmentWhat a piece of junk.. I lose more calls on this phone.What a waste of time!What a waste.What possesed me to get this junk, I have no idea...When I placed my treo into the case, not only was it NOT snug, but there was A LOT of extra room on the sides.When it opens, the battery connection is broken and the device is turned off.While I managed to bend the leaf spring back in place, the metal now has enough stress that it will break on the next drop.Will order from them again!wont work right or atleast for me.Worked great!.Works great!.Worst Customer Service Ever.Worst customer service.Worst ever.WORST PHONE EVER.Worst software ever used.... If I could give this zero stars I would.Would not reccommend.Yet Plantronincs continues to use the same flawed charger design.You also cannot take pictures with it in the case because the lense is covered.You can not answer calls with the unit, never worked once!you could only take 2 videos at a time and the quality was very poor.You get what you pay for I guess.You need two hands to operate the screen.This software interface is decade old and cannot compete with new software designs.You never know if you pushed it hard enough or the right number of times for the function you want or not.
