Not tasty and the texture was just nasty.Not to mention the combination of pears, almonds and bacon is a big winner!Nothing special.Now I am getting angry and I want my damn pho.Now the burgers aren't as good, the pizza which used to be amazing is doughy and flavorless.Now the pizza itself was good the peanut sauce was very tasty.Now this dish was quite flavourful.Of all the dishes, the salmon was the best, but all were great.Oh this is such a thing of beauty, this restaurant.Omelets are to die for!OMG I felt like I had never eaten Thai food until this dish.OMG, the food was delicioso!On a positive note, our server was very attentive and provided great service.On the good side, the staff was genuinely pleasant and enthusiastic - a real treat.On the ground, right next to our table was a large, smeared, been-stepped-in-and-tracked-everywhere pile of green bird poop.On the up side, their cafe serves really good food.On three different occasions I asked for well done or medium well, and all three times I got the bloodiest piece of meat on my plate.Once you get inside you'll be impressed with the place.Once your food arrives it's meh.One nice thing was that they added gratuity on the bill since our party was larger than 6 or 8, and they didn't expect more tip than that.One of the few places in Phoenix that I would definately go back to again .Only Pros : Large seating area/ Nice bar area/ Great simple drink menu/ The BEST brick oven pizza with homemade dough!Ordered a double cheeseburger & got a single patty that was falling apart (picture uploaded) Yeah, still sucks.Ordered an appetizer and took 40 minutes and then the pizza another 10 minutes.Ordered burger rare came in we'll done.Our server was fantastic and when he found out the wife loves roasted garlic and bone marrow, he added extra to our meal and another marrow to go!Our server was super nice and checked on us many times.Our server was very nice and attentive as were the other serving staff.Our server was very nice, and even though he looked a little overwhelmed with all of our needs, he stayed professional and friendly until the end.Our waiter was very attentive, friendly, and informative.Over rated.Overall I was not impressed and would not go back.Overall I wasn't very impressed with Noca.Overall, a great experience.Overall, I don't think that I would take my parents to this place again because they made most of the similar complaints that I silently felt too.Overall, I like there food and the service.Overall, I like this place a lot.Overall, I was very disappointed with the quality of food at Bouchon.Overpriced for what you are getting.Owner's are really great people.!Paying $7.85 for a hot dog and fries that looks like it came out of a kid's meal at the Wienerschnitzel is not my idea of a good meal.Penne vodka excellent!Perfect for someone (me) who only likes beer ice cold, or in this case, even colder.Perhaps I caught them on an off night judging by the other reviews, but I'm not inspired to go back.Phenomenal food, service and ambiance.Please stay away from the shrimp stir fried noodles.Plus, it's only 8 bucks.Point your finger at any item on the menu, order it and you won't be disappointed.Poor service, the waiter made me feel like I was stupid every time he came to the table.Pretty awesome place.Pretty cool I would say.Pretty good beer selection too.Prices are very reasonable, flavors are spot on, the sauce is home made, and the slaw is not drenched in mayo.Pricing is a bit of a concern at Mellow Mushroom.Probably never coming back, and wouldn't recommend it.Probably not in a hurry to go back.REAL sushi lovers, let's be honest - Yama is not that good.Reasonably priced also!Restaurant is always full but never a wait.RUDE & INCONSIDERATE MANAGEMENT.Ryan's Bar is definitely one Edinburgh establishment I won't be revisiting.Sadly, Gordon Ramsey's Steak is a place we shall sharply avoid during our next trip to Vegas.Same evening, him and I are both drastically sick.Sauce was tasteless.say bye bye to your tip lady!Seafood was limited to boiled shrimp and crab legs but the crab legs definitely did not taste fresh.seems like a good quick place to grab a bite of some familiar pub food, but do yourself a favor and look elsewhere.Seriously flavorful delights, folks.Seriously killer hot chai latte.Server did a great job handling our large rowdy table.Service is also cute.Service is friendly and inviting.Service is perfect and the family atmosphere is nice to see."Service is quick and even ""to go"" orders are just like we like it!"Service is quick and friendly.Service stinks here!Service sucks.Service was excellent and prices are pretty reasonable considering this is Vegas and located inside the Crystals shopping mall by Aria.Service was exceptional and food was a good as all the reviews.Service was fantastic.Service was fine and the waitress was friendly.Service was good and the company was better!Service was slow and not attentive.Service was very prompt.She ordered a toasted English muffin that came out untoasted.She was quite disappointed although some blame needs to be placed at her door.Shrimp- When I unwrapped it (I live only 1/2 a mile from Brushfire) it was literally ice cold.Similarly, the delivery man did not say a word of apology when our food was 45 minutes late.So absolutley fantastic.So don't go there if you are looking for good food...So flavorful and has just the perfect amount of heat.So good I am going to have to review this place twice - once hereas a tribute to the place and once as a tribute to an event held here last night.So in a nutshell: 1) The restaraunt smells like a combination of a dirty fish market and a sewer.So they performed.So we went to Tigerlilly and had a fantastic afternoon!Soggy and not good.Some highlights : Great quality nigiri here!Some may say this buffet is pricey but I think you get what you pay for and this place you are getting quite a lot!Sooooo good!!Sorry, I will not be getting food from here anytime soon :(Special thanks to Dylan T. for the recommendation on what to order :) All yummy for my tummy.Spend your money and time some place else.Spend your money elsewhere.Stopped by during the late May bank holiday off Rick Steve recommendation and loved it.Stopped by this place while in Madison for the Ironman, very friendly, kind staff.Strike 2, who wants to be rushed.Talk about great customer service of course we will be back.Tasted like dirt.Terrible management.Terrible service!"That just SCREAMS ""LEGIT"" in my book...somethat's also pretty rare here in Vegas."That said, our mouths and bellies were still quite pleased.That's right....the red velvet cake.....ohhh this stuff is so good.The ambiance here did not feel like a buffet setting, but more of a douchey indoor garden for tea and biscuits.The ambiance isn't much better.The ambiance was incredible.The ambience is wonderful and there is music playing.The atmosphere here is fun.The atmosphere is modern and hip, while maintaining a touch of coziness.The atmosphere was great with a lovely duo of violinists playing songs we requested.The bartender was also nice.The bathrooms are clean and the place itself is well decorated.The best place in Vegas for breakfast (just check out a Sat, or Sun.The best place to go for a tasty bowl of Pho!The black eyed peas and sweet potatoes... UNREAL!The block was amazing.The Buffet at Bellagio was far from what I anticipated.The buffet is small and all the food they offered was BLAND."The building itself seems pretty neat; the bathroom is pretty trippy, but I wouldn't eat here again."The burger had absolutely no flavor - the meat itself was totally bland, the burger was overcooked and there was no charcoal flavor.The burger is good beef, cooked just right."The burger... I got the ""Gold Standard"" a $17 burger and was kind of disappointed."The Burrittos Blah!The bus boy on the other hand was so rude.The cashew cream sauce was bland and the vegetables were undercooked.The cashier had no care what so ever on what I had to say it still ended up being wayyy overpriced.The cashier was friendly and even brought the food out to me.The chains, which I'm no fan of, beat this place easily.The chefs were friendly and did a good job.The chicken dishes are OK, the beef is like shoe leather.The chicken I got was definitely reheated and was only ok, the wedges were cold and soggy.The chicken was deliciously seasoned and had the perfect fry on the outside and moist chicken on the inside.The chicken wings contained the driest chicken meat I have ever eaten.The chipolte ranch dipping sause was tasteless, seemed thin and watered down with no heat.The chips and sals a here is amazing!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!The chips and salsa were really good, the salsa was very fresh.The chips that came out were dripping with grease, and mostly not edible.The classic Maine Lobster Roll was fantastic.The cocktails are all handmade and delicious.The cow tongue and cheek tacos are amazing.The cr__pe was delicate and thin and moist.The croutons also taste homemade which is an extra plus.The deal included 5 tastings and 2 drinks, and Jeff went above and beyond what we expected.The decor is nice, and the piano music soundtrack is pleasant."The descriptions said ""yum yum sauce"" and another said ""eel sauce"", yet another said ""spicy mayo""...well NONE of the rolls had sauces on them."The desserts were a bit strange.The dining space is tiny, but elegantly decorated and comfortable.The feel of the dining room was more college cooking course than high class dining and the service was slow at best.The first time I ever came here I had an amazing experience, I still tell people how awesome the duck was.The flair bartenders are absolutely amazing!The folks at Otto always make us feel so welcome and special.The food came out at a good pace.The food is about on par with Denny's, which is to say, not good at all.The food is delicious and just spicy enough, so be sure to ask for spicier if you prefer it that way.The food is good."the food is not tasty at all, not to say its ""real traditional Hunan style""."the food is rich so order accordingly.The food is very good for your typical bar food.The food sucked, which we expected but it sucked more than we could have imagined.The food was barely lukewarm, so it must have been sitting waiting for the server to bring it out to us.The food was delicious, our bartender was attentive and personable AND we got a great deal!The food was excellent and service was very good.The food was great as always, compliments to the chef.The food was outstanding and the prices were very reasonable.The food was terrible.The food was terrible.The food was very good and I enjoyed every mouthful, an enjoyable relaxed venue for couples small family groups etc.The food was very good.The food wasn't good.The food, amazing.The fried rice was dry as well.The fries were great too.The fries were not hot, and neither was my burger.The goat taco didn't skimp on the meat and wow what FLAVOR!The Greek dressing was very creamy and flavorful.The grilled chicken was so tender and yellow from the saffron seasoning.The guys all had steaks, and our steak loving son who has had steak at the best and worst places said it was the best steak he's ever eaten.The Han Nan Chicken was also very tasty.The Heart Attack Grill in downtown Vegas is an absolutely flat-lined excuse for a restaurant.The inside is really quite nice and very clean.The jalapeno bacon is soooo good.The Jamaican mojitos are delicious.The kids play area is NASTY!The last 3 times I had lunch here has been bad.The lighting is just dark enough to set the mood.The live music on Fridays totally blows.The Macarons here are insanely good.The management is rude.The manager was the worst.The meat was pretty dry, I had the sliced brisket and pulled pork.The menu had so much good stuff on it i could not decide!The menu is always changing, food quality is going down & service is extremely slow.The nachos are a MUST HAVE!The one down note is the ventilation could use some upgrading.The only downside is the service.The only good thing was our waiter, he was very helpful and kept the bloddy mary's coming.The only reason to eat here would be to fill up before a night of binge drinking just to get some carbs in your stomach.The only redeeming quality of the restaurant was that it was very inexpensive.The only thing I did like was the prime rib and dessert section.The only thing I wasn't too crazy about was their guacamole as I don't like it pur_©ed.The owner used to work at Nobu, so this place is really similar for half the price.The owners are super friendly and the staff is courteous.The pan cakes everyone are raving about taste like a sugary disaster tailored to the palate of a six year old.The pancake was also really good and pretty large at that.The patio seating was very comfortable.The pizza selections are good.The pizza tasted old, super chewy in not a good way.The place was fairly clean but the food simply wasn't worth it.The place was not clean and the food oh so stale!The plantains were the worst I've ever tasted.The poor batter to meat ratio made the chicken tenders very unsatisfying.The portion was huge!The potato chip order was sad... I could probably count how many chips were in that box and it was probably around 12.the potatoes were great and so was the biscuit.The potatoes were like rubber and you could tell they had been made up ahead of time being kept under a warmer.the presentation of the food was awful.The price is reasonable and the service is great.The problem I have is that they charge $11.99 for a sandwich that is no bigger than a Subway sub (which offers better and more amount of vegetables).The real disappointment was our waiter.The refried beans that came with my meal were dried out and crusty and the food was bland.The restaurant atmosphere was exquisite.The restaurant is very clean and has a family restaurant feel to it.The RI style calamari was a joke.The ripped banana was not only ripped, but petrified and tasteless.The roast beef sandwich tasted really good!The salad had just the right amount of sauce to not over power the scallop, which was perfectly cooked.The sangria was about half of a glass wine full and was $12, ridiculous.The scallop dish is quite appalling for value as well.The seafood was fresh and generous in portion.The seasonal fruit was fresh white peach puree.The selection of food was not the best.The selection on the menu was great and so were the prices.The selection was probably the worst I've seen in Vegas.....there was none.The sergeant pepper beef sandwich with auju sauce is an excellent sandwich as well.The server was very negligent of our needs and made us feel very unwelcome... I would not suggest this place!The servers are not pleasant to deal with and they don't always honor Pizza Hut coupons."The servers went back and forth several times, not even so much as an ""Are you being helped?"""The service here is fair at best.The service here leaves a lot to be desired.The service was a bit lacking.The service was a little slow , considering that were served by 3 people servers so the food was coming in a slow pace.The service was extremely slow.The service was great, even the manager came and helped with our table.The service was meh.The service was not up to par, either.The service was outshining & I definitely recommend the Halibut.The service was poor and thats being nice.The service was terrible though.The service was terrible, food was mediocre.The shower area is outside so you can only rinse, not take a full shower, unless you don't mind being nude for everyone to see!The shrimp tender and moist.The sides are delish - mixed mushrooms, yukon gold puree, white corn - beateous.the spaghetti is nothing special whatsoever.The staff are also very friendly and efficient.The staff are great, the ambiance is great.The staff are now not as friendly, the wait times for being served are horrible, no one even says hi for the first 10 minutes.The staff is always super friendly and helpful, which is especially cool when you bring two small boys and a baby!the staff is friendly and the joint is always clean.The staff is great, the food is delish, and they have an incredible beer selection.The staff is super nice and very quick even with the crazy crowds of the downtown juries, lawyers, and court staff.The staff was very attentive.The steak and the shrimp are in my opinion the best entrees at GC.The steak was amazing...rge fillet relleno was the best seafood plate i have ever had!The steaks are all well trimmed and also perfectly cooked.The sweet potato fries were very good and seasoned well.The sweet potato tots were good but the onion rings were perfection or as close as I have had.The tables outside are also dirty a lot of the time and the workers are not always friendly and helpful with the menu.The turkey and roast beef were bland.The vanilla ice cream was creamy and smooth while the profiterole (choux) pastry was fresh enough.The vegetables are so fresh and the sauce feels like authentic Thai.The Veggitarian platter is out of this world!The waiter wasn't helpful or friendly and rarely checked on us.The waitress and manager are so friendly.The waitress was friendly and happy to accomodate for vegan/veggie options.The waitresses are very friendly.The warm beer didn't help.The whole experience was underwhelming, and I think we'll just go to Ninja Sushi next time.The Wife hated her meal (coconut shrimp), and our friends really did not enjoy their meals, either.The wontons were thin, not thick and chewy, almost melt in your mouth.The WORST EXPERIENCE EVER.The worst was the salmon sashimi.The yellowtail carpaccio was melt in your mouth fresh.Their chow mein is so good!Their daily specials are always a hit with my group.Their frozen margaritas are WAY too sugary for my taste.Their menu is diverse, and reasonably priced.Their monster chicken fried steak and eggs is my all time favorite.Their regular toasted bread was equally satisfying with the occasional pats of butter... Mmmm...!Their rotating beers on tap is also a highlight of this place.Their steaks are 100% recommended!Then our food came out, disappointment ensued.Then, as if I hadn't wasted enough of my life there, they poured salt in the wound by drawing out the time it took to bring the check.There is not a deal good enough that would drag me into that establishment again.There is nothing authentic about this place.There is nothing privileged about working/eating there.There is really nothing for me at postinos, hope your experience is betterThere is so much good food in Vegas that I feel cheated for wasting an eating opportunity by going to Rice and Company.There was a warm feeling with the service and I felt like their guest for a special treat.There was hardly any meat.These are the nicest restaurant owners I've ever come across.These were so good we ordered them twice.They also have the best cheese crisp in town.They also now serve Indian naan bread with hummus and some spicy pine nut sauce that was out of this world.They brought a fresh batch of fries and I was thinking yay something warm but no!They could serve it with just the vinaigrette and it may make for a better overall dish, but it was still very good.They dropped more than the ball.They had a toro tartare with a cavier that was extraordinary and I liked the thinly sliced wagyu with white truffle.They have a good selection of food including a massive meatloaf sandwich, a crispy chicken wrap, a delish tuna melt and some tasty burgers.They have a plethora of salads and sandwiches, and everything I've tried gets my seal of approval.They have a really nice atmosphere.They have great dinners.They have horrible attitudes towards customers, and talk down to each one when customers don't enjoy their food.They know how to make them here.They never brought a salad we asked for.They really want to make your experience a good one.They were excellent.They were golden-crispy and delicious.They will customize your order any way you'd like, my usual is Eggplant with Green Bean stir fry, love it!Things that went wrong: - They burned the saganaki.Third, the cheese on my friend's burger was cold.This greedy corporation will NEVER see another dime from me!This hole in the wall has great Mexican street tacos, and friendly staff.This is a disgrace.This is a good joint.This is a GREAT place to eat!This is a great restaurant at the Mandalay Bay.This is a really fantastic Thai restaurant which is definitely worth a visit.This is an Outstanding little restaurant with some of the Best Food I have ever tasted.This is an unbelievable BARGAIN!This is my new fav Vegas buffet spot.This is one of the best bars with food in Vegas.This is one of the better buffets that I have been to.This is some seriously good pizza and I'm an expert/connisseur on the topic.This is the place where I first had pho and it was amazing!!this is the worst sushi i have ever eat besides Costco's.This is was due to the fact that it took 20 minutes to be acknowledged, then another 35 minutes to get our food...and they kept forgetting things.This isn't a small family restaurant, this is a fine dining establishment.This one is simply a disappointment.This place deserves no stars.This place deserves one star and 90% has to do with the food.This place has a lot of promise but fails to deliver.This place has it!This place is a jewel in Las Vegas, and exactly what I've been hoping to find in nearly ten years living here.This place is amazing!This place is awesome if you want something light and healthy during the summer.This place is disgusting!this place is good.This place is great!!!!!!!!!!!!!!This place is hands-down one of the best places to eat in the Phoenix metro area.This place is horrible and way overpriced.This place is like Chipotle, but BETTER.This place is not quality sushi, it is not a quality restaurant.This place is not worth your time, let alone Vegas.This place is overpriced, not consistent with their boba, and it really is OVERPRICED!This place is pretty good, nice little vibe in the restaurant.This place is two thumbs up....way up.This place is way too overpriced for mediocre food.This place lacked style!!This place receives stars for their APPETIZERS!!!This place should honestly be blown up.This place was such a nice surprise!This really is how Vegas fine dining used to be, right down to the menus handed to the ladies that have no prices listed.this was a different cut than the piece the other day but still wonderful and tender s well as well flavored.This was like the final blow!This was my first and only Vegas buffet and it did not disappoint.This was my first crawfish experience, and it was delicious!This was my first time and I can't wait until the next.This wonderful experience made this place a must-stop whenever we are in town again.Thoroughly disappointed!Those burgers were amazing.Thus far, have only visited twice and the food was absolutely delicious each time.To my disbelief, each dish qualified as the worst version of these foods I have ever tasted.To summarize... the food was incredible, nay, transcendant... but nothing brings me joy quite like the memory of the pneumatic condiment dispenser.Today is the second time I've been to their lunch buffet and it was pretty good.Today was my first taste of a Buldogis Gourmet Hot Dog and I have to tell you it was more than I ever thought possible.Tonight I had the Elk Filet special...and it sucked.too bad cause I know it's family owned, I really wanted to like this place.Took an hour to get our food only 4 tables in restaurant my food was Luke warm, Our sever was running around like he was totally overwhelmed.Total brunch fail.Total letdown, I would much rather just go to the Camelback Flower Shop and Cartel Coffee.TOTAL WASTE OF TIME.Tried to go here for lunch and it was a madhouse.Try them in the airport to experience some tasty food and speedy, friendly service.Unfortunately, it only set us up for disapppointment with our entrees.Unfortunately, it was not good.Unfortunately, we must have hit the bakery on leftover day because everything we ordered was STALE.Update.....went back for a second time and it was still just as amazingVery bad Experience!Very convenient, since we were staying at the MGM!Very disappointing!!!Very friendly staff.Very good food, great atmosphere.1Very good lunch spot.Very good, though!Very poor service.very slow at seating even with reservation.very tough and very short on flavor!Very Very Disappointed ordered the $35 Big Bay Plater.Very very fun chef.Very, very sad.WAAAAAAyyyyyyyyyy over rated is all I am saying.Waited 2 hours & never got either of our pizzas as many other around us who came in later did!Waited and waited and waited.Waiter was a jerk.Waitress was a little slow in service.Waitress was good though!Waitress was sweet and funny.walked in and the place smelled like an old grease trap and only 2 others there eating."We also ordered the spinach and avocado salad; the ingredients were sad and the dressing literally had zero taste."We are so glad we found this place.We aren't ones to make a scene at restaurants but I just don't get it...definitely lost the love after this one!We asked for the bill to leave without eating and they didn't bring that either.We could not believe how dirty the oysters were!We definately enjoyed ourselves.We enjoy their pizza and brunch.We got sitting fairly fast, but, ended up waiting 40 minutes just to place our order, another 30 minutes before the food arrived.We got the food and apparently they have never heard of salt and the batter on the fish was chewy.We had 7 at our table and the service was pretty fast.We had a group of 70+ when we claimed we would only have 40 and they handled us beautifully.We had fantastic service, and were pleased by the atmosphere.We had so much to say about the place before we walked in that he expected it to be amazing, but was quickly disappointed.We literally sat there for 20 minutes with no one asking to take our order.We loved the biscuits!!!We loved the place.We made the drive all the way from North Scottsdale... and I was not one bit disappointed!We ordered some old classics and some new dishes after going there a few times and were sorely disappointed with everything.We ordered the duck rare and it was pink and tender on the inside with a nice char on the outside.We recently witnessed her poor quality of management towards other guests as well.We sat another ten minutes and finally gave up and left.We started with the tuna sashimi which was brownish in color and obviously wasn't fresh.We thought you'd have to venture further away to get good sushi, but this place really hit the spot that night.We waited an hour for what was a breakfast I could have done 100 times better at home.We waited for forty five minutes in vain.We waited for thirty minutes to be seated (although there were 8 vacant tables and we were the only folks waiting).We walked away stuffed and happy about our first Vegas buffet experience.We watched our waiter pay a lot more attention to other tables and ignore us.We were promptly greeted and seated.We were sat right on time and our server from the get go was FANTASTIC!We will not be coming back.We won't be going back anytime soon!We won't be going back.We won't be returning.We'd definitely go back here again.We'll never go again.We've have gotten a much better service from the pizza place next door than the services we received from this restaurant.We've tried to like this place but after 10+ times I think we're done with them.Weird vibe from owners.Went for lunch - service was slow.Went in for happy hour, great list of wines.What a great double cheeseburger!What a mistake that was!What a mistake.What did bother me, was the slow service.What happened next was pretty....off putting.What I really like there is the crepe station.What SHOULD have been a hilarious, yummy Christmas Eve dinner to remember was the biggest fail of the entire trip for us.When I opened the sandwich, I was impressed, but not in a good way.When I received my Pita it was huge it did have a lot of meat in it so thumbs up there.When I'm on this side of town, this will definitely be a spot I'll hit up again!When my mom and I got home she immediately got sick and she only had a few bites of salad.When my order arrived, one of the gyros was missing.Which are small and not worth the price.Why are these sad little vegetables so overcooked?Will be back again!will definitely be back!Will go back next trip out.WILL NEVER EVER GO BACK AND HAVE TOLD MANY PEOPLE WHAT HAD HAPPENED.Will never, ever go back.Will not be back!Will not be back.Won't ever go here again.Won't go back.Wonderful lil tapas and the ambience made me feel all warm and fuzzy inside.Worse of all, he humiliated his worker right in front of me..Bunch of horrible name callings.Worst food/service I've had in a while.Worst martini ever!Worst service to boot, but that is the least of their worries.Worst Thai ever.Would come back again if I had a sushi craving while in Vegas.Would not go back.Would not recommend to others.Wow very spicy but delicious.Wow... Loved this place.you can watch them preparing the delicious food!)You can't beat that.You cant go wrong with any of the food here.You get incredibly fresh fish, prepared with care.You won't be disappointed.Your servers suck, wait, correction, our server Heimer sucked.Your staff spends more time talking to themselves than me.
